# fibonacci-sequence-basic

This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence for a specified number of terms.

## Overview

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms, where `n` is provided by the user.

## Features

- Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
- Uses an iterative approach for efficient calculation.
